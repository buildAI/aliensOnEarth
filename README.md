# Aliens On Earth
Console based application which can take details and generate a pdf or text file.

Here in this repository the main.swift file consists of code for problem statement and the pdf_template.txt is the template for a PDF structure.

To run the code just download the main.swift and pdf_template.txt.

In the main.swift there are paths defined to the pdf_template and the output files.

Here while I ran this on my machine I used local path details. In order to run them on your machine just paste location of the pdf_template and your interest of output files location to the respective variables that store location of fies and run the main.swift in the terminal to see the application running.

In the main.swift I've defined two different output formats as functions. Inorder to add a new plugin we can get the template of the required plugin and write a function to give an output of the specified format
