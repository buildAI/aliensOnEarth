# Aliens On Earth

Clone the repo into your Developer directory.

In terminal compile the files using the command "swiftc file_formats.swift dictionary_list.swift main.swift".

Then run the main file by using the command "./main".

To extend the usability of the application just paste the respective function file of the format in "file_formats.swift". Make sure the function type is same as already predefined functions ex: outputPDFFile.

Then just add the function name and display type as values, autoincrementer1++,autoincrementer2++ as keys respectively in the "dictionary_list.swift". There after just compile and run using the above commands you can see the application running.
